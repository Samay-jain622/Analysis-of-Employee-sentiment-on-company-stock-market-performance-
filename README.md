This project explores the relationship between employee sentiment toward their employer and the company's stock market performance. Through rigorous time series analysis, Granger Causality tests, and statistical clustering techniques, we aim to identify patterns and clusters where employee sentiment significantly impacts stock behavior.

🔍 Key Highlights:
Time Series Analysis: To observe trends and lagged relationships between sentiment and stock performance.

Granger Causality: To evaluate whether employee sentiment can statistically forecast stock movements.

Clustering Analysis: Identified distinct clusters where sentiment plays a stronger or weaker role.

🧩 Multidimensional Approach:
To ensure a robust and comprehensive analysis, the following variables were incorporated:

Company-specific financial indicators: Stock volume, P/E ratio, etc.

Market volatility metrics: VIX Index.

Macroeconomic factors: Crude oil prices, Brent oil prices, gold prices, and more.

This analysis aims to uncover how internal (employee-driven) and external (market/economic) factors jointly influence stock performance.
